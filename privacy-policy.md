Privacy Policy – HotelKey Member Notes Extension

Last updated: January 2026

Overview

The HotelKey Member Notes browser extension is designed to assist hotel staff by displaying internal member history notes directly within the HotelKey front desk web application. This privacy policy explains what data the extension accesses, how it is used, and how it is protected.

Data Accessed by the Extension

The extension accesses the following data only while the user is actively using the HotelKey web application:

Website Content

Loyalty or membership numbers that are visible on HotelKey pages

Text or input field values displayed to the authenticated user within the HotelKey interface

This data is used solely to determine whether internal notes exist for a given membership number.

Authentication and Secure Data Access

The extension uses Microsoft OAuth 2.0 authentication via the identity permission to securely access Microsoft Graph APIs.

This authentication is required to:

Read internal staff notes from a SharePoint list

Write or update notes where authorized

The extension does not collect, store, or process user passwords or credentials. Authentication is handled entirely by Microsoft.

Data Storage

Temporary data such as authentication tokens and cached lookup results may be stored locally using the browser’s storage APIs.

This data is used only to improve performance and reduce repeated network requests.

No data is stored outside the user’s browser or organizational Microsoft environment.

Data Not Collected

The extension does not collect:

Personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or addresses

Financial or payment information

Health information

Location data

Web browsing history outside the HotelKey application

Keystrokes, mouse movements, or user activity tracking

Personal communications such as emails or messages

Data Sharing

The extension does not sell, transfer, or share data with third parties.

Data access is limited to the authenticated user’s organization and Microsoft services required for the extension’s functionality.

All access is governed by Microsoft permission scopes granted during authentication.

Remote Code

The extension does not use remote code.
All JavaScript executed by the extension is packaged within the extension itself.

Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated if the extension’s functionality changes. Any updates will be reflected on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.
